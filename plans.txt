revamp the story to make it different enough basically

current story so far:

Boyfriend returns to Bambi's little ol' hummble abode and raps oncemore! The power that he wields from his uhh phone transports them into the 3D realm though.

BF isn't meant to be there, so they sing some more until BF wins.

Applecore happens

Dave intrudes and sings for two songs and it gets chaotic

BF is transported to the Baldi mod world and sings against OG Dave.

GF is "probably" transported deeper into the 3D world and sings against odd people idk i dont have a song chosen yet

Side story: story menu will be used to put the freeplay songs remaining into some sort of cohesive side story to explain how boyfriend gets there
