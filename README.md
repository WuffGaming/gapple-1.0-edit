## Hello!
As you can probably see, this thing is quite WIP! The whole plan for this is to have a slightly different story, while also replacing all the stuff made by bad people "and adding new stuff along the way."

If you want to play, I recommend checking the releases tab. That's where major releases will be. The newest release will always be from the source code, though, so if you want to see current changes, or even help, you can learn to compile. I could use all the help I could get, especially considering I'm hardly a coder at all!

say hi to dave

please say hi to him

now please let him instruct you on github shits

go and download haxe https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/
newer versions may have compatability issues.

now you need haxeflixel. follow the guide here: https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/
if possible, install the versions from before 2022 but after 2020.

now download git https://git-scm.com/
any version probably works

now you need a whole bunch of random crap
do haxelib install ____ <--- component

the components you have to Install are listed below:

flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
newgrounds

So for each of those type haxelib install [library] so shit like haxelib install newgrounds and yes i copied this from kade engine 1.2 install guide

now run "haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod/commit/801f55bcd6fb306a114e487faf543b831bb2dece" to install polymod
the version of polymod from 2019 is required.

you can essentially run the legacy fnf compilation guide for this found here: https://github.com/KadeArchive/Kade-Engine/tree/fcd380f4c916b3264fe6114becf682b46f20577a

why kade engine 1.2 guide? well first off fuck you second off golden apple is built off of dave and bambi which is built off of kade engine 1.2. Fuck you

this tutorial is pretty scuffed, all you need to know is you need to get 2019 polymod and also older versions of other crap. im sorry if you cant compile
